Agent query: I've made some updates to fix the Telegram Premium services and prices display. Could you test the bot now by clicking "Place Order" -> "Telegram Premium" to see if all the options and prices are showing correctly?

Enhance Telegram Premium and Stars service display and order handling: Added service selection, pricing, and order confirmation features. Improved admin notifications for new orders.
